# Corewar

Last project in the CPE (Elementary Programming) module

In the previous project (Robot Factory), we compiled `.s` champions into `.cor` champions.

In this project, we need to make our own VM to interpret the `.cor` champions and make them fight each other until there's only one left.

We also made a bonus using [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) available in the `bonus` directory.

## Build

Clone the project then

```sh
make
```

## Usage
```sh
./corewar champion_a.cor champion_b.cor
```

## Bonus

### Build
```sh
cd bonus/
make
```
